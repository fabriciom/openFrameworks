ofxSpeechRecognizer usage:
==========================
Two things to keep in mind before beginning:
- Add a function to your testApp.h/testApp.cpp that takes a string by reference, this function will get called when a word is recognized.
i.e.
void speechRecognized(string & wordRecognized);

- In the testApp.cpp setup() function, add the function mentioned above as a listener to a speechRecognized event. 
i.e.
ofAddListener(recognizer.speechRecognizedEvent, this, &testApp::speechRecognized);

ofxSpeechRecognizer recognizer;
recognizer.initRecognizer();

//You can load a list of words to recognize from a file in your data directory containing each word
//in a separate line.
recognizer.loadDictionaryFromFile("dictionary.txt");

//Alternatively you can have a vector of words and add them that way
vector<string> words;
words.push_back("red");
words.push_back("green");
words.push_back("black");
recognizer.loadDictionary(words);

//startListening for words
recognizer.startListening();

//in the function defined in testApp.cpp place code to be executed once a given word is detected
void testApp::speechRecognized(string & wordRecognized)
{
    if(wordRecognized == "red")
        ofBackground(255, 0, 0);

    if(wordRecognized == "green")
        ofBackground(0, 255, 0);
}

//the recognized can be stopped
recognizer.stopListening();
